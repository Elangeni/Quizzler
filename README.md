# Quizzler
This is an iOS app written in Objective C and Swift. It is a play on the popular Quiz Up game. It began as a tutorial from the London App Brewery, but I added some more features as I became more comfortable.

The goal of this app was to learn about the holy grail of mobile design patterns: the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. A design pattern is simply a repeatable and optimised solution to a common software problem.

## What I learned

* What is a design pattern and how is it used in programming.
* How to use the Model-View-Controller or MVC pattern for app development.
* Learn about Object Oriented Programming.
* How to store data locally.
* How to incorporate third party libraries and how to display Heads Up Displays (HUDs).
* How to refactor code and stay organised.
* Learn about class initialisation. 
* How to programmatically change UI elements such as Labels and Views.
* Start thinking about data encapsulation and how to keep your data safe from corruption.
